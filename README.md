DESCRIPTION:An Interactive Quiz Application is a web-based program that allows users to answer a series of questions and receive instant feedback. The app is intended to simulate a quiz environment where users can test their knowledge on various subjects. It is commonly used in e-learning, school assessments, and casual knowledge competitions.This application will include multiple-choice questions (MCQs), a scoring system, and immediate feedback once a question is answered. The questions should load dynamically.Clean and responsive layout using HTML and CSS.Clear navigation with "Start Quiz", "Next", and "Submit" buttons.A progress bar or question tracker showing current question number.Highlight correct/incorrect answers instantly.Display the final score at the end of the quiz.Optionally, provide feedback based on score percentage.Display the final score at the end of the quiz.After each selection, show whether the answer is correct.Display the final score at the end of the quizHTML: For structuring the quiz elements.CSS: For styling the interface and making it responsive.JavaScript: The core logic for question rendering, user interaction, scoring, and feedback.This is achieved using HTML for the structural components of the quiz, such as buttons, question containers, and result displays; CSS for visual styling, including fonts, colors, spacing, and responsive design; and JavaScript for the core functionality, such as loading questions, capturing user input, calculating scores, and showing real-time feedback.From a development perspective, HTML serves as the backbone for laying out the different elements of the quiz. CSS is used to style these elements and ensure the application looks professional and adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes. JavaScript is the engine that powers the application’s interactivity—it dynamically renders questions, handles user interactions, manages quiz logic, calculates scores, and generates feedback. Together, these three core web technologies enable developers to create a modern, responsive, and engaging quiz application. After each question is answered, the application must immediately indicate whether the selected answer is correct or incorrect by visually highlighting the response, such as changing the color of the selected option. This instant feedback reinforces learning and keeps users engaged throughout the quiz. At the end of the quiz, the application should calculate and display the final score, showing how many questions were answered correctly out of the total.
